## Device & Architecture Context

QManager Go Edition (`QManager-GO`) is a single-binary Go application (`qmanager-core`) containing an embedded Next.js 16 SPA frontend (`src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/lib/`, `src/types/`, `src/constants/`, compiled to `//go:embed all:out`) and a native Go backend engine (`cmd/server/`, `pkg/api/`, `pkg/at/`, `pkg/modem/`, `pkg/daemon/`, `pkg/tlsgen/`), deployed **onto the modem itself** (Quectel RM520N/RM551E/RM500Q-class running OpenWRT or Linux). The Go server listens on HTTP (port 80) and Auto-TLS HTTPS (port 443) and handles all `/cgi-bin/quecmanager/*` API endpoints natively in memory. Modem AT commands are executed safely via a thread-safe Go `sync.Mutex` AT executor (`pkg/at`). Because the app runs on the device, anything that reboots the modem also kills any in-flight HTTP request — defer reboots via dialog + persistent banner, never `AT+CFUN=1,1` mid-request.

Build using `./build-go.sh` and flash to devices using `./deploy.sh` (Bash/SSH/ADB) or `./deploy.ps1` (PowerShell).

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/BACKEND.md`, `docs/FRONTEND.md`, `docs/API-REFERENCE.md` for full breakdowns.

## Change Workflow

Every code-change request in this repo follows a tier-routed, 6-phase flow. Opus orchestrates; the specialist agents do the work. The user holds the approval gate. This flow is the project default for code changes and supersedes the generic brainstorming / writing-plans / verification skills; test-driven development still applies inside Phase 4 wherever tests exist.

**Signal each phase transition** with a header so the user always knows where we are: `**[Phase 1 — Triage]**`, `**[Phase 2 — Plan]**`, `**[Phase 3 — Approval]**`, `**[Phase 4 — Execute]**`, `**[Phase 5 — Validation]**`, `**[Phase 6 — Docs & Close]**`.

### The 6 Phases

1. **Triage & Recon (Opus):** Classify the request into Tier 0–4 by blast radius. For every **bug fix**, every **Tier 3+** change, and **all Tier 4** work, dispatch `modem-investigator` as a read-only Phase 1 gate — it maps the UI→hook→CGI→`qcmd`→modem flow statically and probes live state via Posh-SSH before any code is written. It returns an evidence report (file paths with line numbers, captured CGI/UCI/nft/log output, findings), never code. Synthesize its findings.
2. **Plan (Opus orchestrates, builders pre-flight):** For Tier 2+, dispatch builder agents in parallel — `backend-writer` (CGI / daemons / libs / init.d / AT flows) and/or `ui-builder` (pages / cards / hooks / types). They return scaffolding + design notes, NOT committed code. Opus synthesizes into ONE plan: tier, agent roster, file list, build order, risks, and the validation the change will need.
3. **Approval Gate (user):** Plan changes here are cheap; later changes are not.
4. **Execute (builders):** Bottom-up for cross-layer work: backend (poller / CGI / lib / init.d) → `validator` gate → hook → component → docs. Parallel where files are independent; sequential where there's a data dependency. `backend-writer` always hands off to `validator` after a meaningful backend change — the static audit is non-negotiable.
5. **Validation (`validator`, mandatory):** After every backend / shell change, run `validator`. It is a single agent that performs both the static audit (CRLF via `.claude/check-crlf.sh`, BusyBox/POSIX compliance, bashisms, `jq` null-handling, lock/trap discipline, numeric-input guards, CGI envelope, reboot/CFUN safety) **and** scoped on-device SSH verification of the deployed change. Loop failures back to Phase 4 — but after **2 failed validation rounds**, stop and surface to the user instead of looping further.
6. **Docs & Close (`docs-writer`):** Update `docs/`, the feature-doc routing tables in `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/features/README.md`, and `RELEASE_NOTE.md` as needed. Report summary + git status.

### Tier Routing

| Tier | Scope | Flow |
|------|-------|------|
| 0 | Typos, comments, copy edits, version bumps | Direct edit, no agents, no plan |
| 1 | Single existing file in one layer | Skip Phase 2–3. Implement + `validator` (if shell) + maybe docs |
| 2 | New feature, single layer | Full flow; pre-flight is the layer's builder only |
| 3 | Cross-layer feature (CGI + hook + component, or a poller field consumed across layers) | Full flow; `modem-investigator` runs the Phase 1 recon gate |
| 4 | Installer / `init.d` services / UCI schema / firewall (fw4 + nftables, incl. DPI nft rules) / OTA pipeline | Full flow with `modem-investigator` as a hard Phase 1 gate, and `validator` doing on-device verification of the deployed change |

Bug fixes match the tier of the *fix*, not the bug — and always get a Phase 1 `modem-investigator` recon first, because "understand the live flow before touching it" is cheaper than a wrong fix. Pure refactors with no behavior change drop one tier (`validator` still runs for any shell change; builders don't pre-flight).

### Agent Roster

All agents are defined in `.claude/agents/`. Models are pinned per agent — the orchestrator does not choose them.

- **Recon gate (Phase 1, read-only, Opus):** `modem-investigator` — traces the full stack statically and probes the live modem read-only via Posh-SSH; returns an evidence report and can halt work before code is written.
- **Builders (Phases 2 & 4, Opus):** `backend-writer` (BusyBox `/bin/sh` backend — CGI, daemons, libs, init.d, AT/`qcmd` flows, UCI, apply pipelines, locks), `ui-builder` (Next.js / shadcn / Tailwind frontend; may delegate craft to the Impeccable skill).
- **Validator (Phase 5, Sonnet):** `validator` — static BusyBox/CRLF/`jq` audit **and** scoped on-device verification. The closing gate before any backend change is done.
- **Closer (Phase 6, Sonnet):** `docs-writer`.

### Hard Rules

- **Tier is decided once, up-front.** If tempted to skip the recon or the validator mid-flow, re-triage rather than skip.
- **`validator` runs after every backend / shell change.** It is the single source of truth for BusyBox safety and on-device behavior; static-only passes have shipped broken scripts before, so let it do the on-device leg whenever the change is deployable.
- **`modem-investigator` is read-only and fails loud.** If recon reveals the change needs a write action on live state, or surfaces a broken invariant, it halts and reports — the main thread re-routes through `backend-writer` + `validator`.
- **`docs-writer` is the closing bracket.** If it doesn't run on Tier 2+, the change isn't done.
- **Builders and validators don't see the orchestrator's conversation.** Each dispatch is a self-contained brief with file paths, schemas, the live evidence from `modem-investigator`, and the relevant `CLAUDE.md` / `DESIGN.md` / `PRODUCT.md` sections inlined.
- **No in-flight reboot.** Any change that calls `reboot` / `AT+CFUN=1,1` mid-request must be deferred and surfaced via the deferred-reboot banner — `validator` rejects inline reboots in a CGI response path.

### Worktree Discipline (Tier 2+)

Parallel branches and parallel builders must never cross-contaminate commits. Two layers of isolation, both harness-native:

1. **Run-level — every Tier 2+ run gets its own worktree.** Immediately after the Phase 3 approval gate (before any builder writes a file), call `EnterWorktree` to create an isolated checkout on a fresh branch named for the change (e.g. `wt/dns-presets`). The session CWD moves there and every subsequently spawned teammate inherits it, so all commits land on that branch regardless of what other sessions do to `development-home` or any other branch. Phases 1–3 (recon/plan) stay in the main checkout — they're read-only and should see the branch the user actually asked about. Tier 0/1 edits stay in-place, no worktree.
2. **Agent-level — isolate builders only when file sets overlap.** If two builders would touch overlapping or uncertain file sets in parallel, spawn them with `isolation: "worktree"` on the Agent call and reconcile their results into the run worktree. When file sets are provably disjoint (the normal case — backend in `scripts/`, UI in `components/`), skip it; they share the run worktree.

**On entry, fix the two things a fresh worktree is missing:**
- **`.env` is gitignored** → copy it from the main checkout into the worktree or `modem-investigator`/`validator` silently lose SSH access to the live modem. Verify `git check-ignore .env` still holds in the worktree; never commit it.
- **`node_modules` is absent** → run `bun install` in the worktree lazily, only if the change actually needs a frontend build/lint/tsc pass; backend-only changes skip it.

**Close-out (Phase 6):** after `validator` passes and `docs-writer` closes, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion` — merge back into the originating branch, keep the branch for a PR, or discard — then `ExitWorktree`. Never auto-merge.

### Skip Phrases

User can short-circuit by saying "just do it" / "skip the plan" / "tier 0 it" — Opus drops to direct execution. Otherwise the flow is the default.

### Orchestration Mode ("orchestrate")

When the user says **"orchestrate"** (e.g. "orchestrate this", "orchestrate a team for…"), run the 6-phase flow above as a **multi-agent team**, not a solo pass. This is the default team-execution mode of the same flow — tiers, gates, and the user approval gate all still apply. Default shape:

- **Opus is the head architect, not a worker.** Opus plans, briefs teammates, synthesizes their evidence, holds the approval gate, and makes the calls. The legwork (recon, builds, validation, docs) goes to teammates. Opus still does its own targeted reads to *judge* teammate reports rather than rubber-stamp them.
- **Teammates are Sonnet, spawned liberally and in parallel.** Each gets a **self-contained brief** (file paths, schemas, the live evidence, the relevant CLAUDE.md/DESIGN.md sections inlined) — they don't see the orchestrator's conversation. Set `model: sonnet` on the Agent call. Use the project agents (`modem-investigator`, `backend-writer`, `ui-builder`, `validator`, `docs-writer`) plus `Explore`/`general-purpose` for recon.
- **One teammate is always a dedicated devil's advocate.** Its job is to attack the leading hypotheses, surface what the team is underweighting, and stop the team from "fixing" accurate telemetry or chasing a phantom. Mandatory for any investigation.
- **Phase 1 recon fans out.** Run several read-only agents at once on different leads (live `modem-investigator` probing, static `Explore`, a delta/compare angle, the devil's advocate). When new evidence lands mid-flight, **redirect a running teammate with `SendMessage`** instead of re-spawning. If a backgrounded teammate goes idle without delivering its written report, ping it for the report.
- **Synthesize, then gate.** Fold all reports into ONE plan and use **`AskUserQuestion`** at the Phase 3 approval gate and for any real scoping decision (which fixes, build order, live-confirm-first). Don't start Phase 4 builders until the user approves.
- **Worktree Discipline applies (see above).** `EnterWorktree` right after the approval gate so the whole team commits onto the run's own branch; `isolation: "worktree"` per builder only when their file sets overlap; ask-at-close merge via `AskUserQuestion`, then `ExitWorktree`.
- **Execute → validate → docs, with a task board.** Builders run bottom-up (parallel where files are independent), `validator` gates every backend/shell change on-device, `docs-writer` closes. Track the whole thing with `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` (owners + blockers) so the user can follow progress.
- **Respect standing prefs inside the team.** UI craft is done by Opus via the Impeccable skill, not dispatched to `ui-builder` for the build (`ui-builder`/`Explore` may still recon the surfaces). Sonnet teammates do the rest.

The same Skip Phrases still apply — "just do it" drops orchestration back to a solo direct pass.

## Design Context

See **`docs/design/PRODUCT.md`** (strategic: register, users, brand personality, anti-references, the six design principles including the safety principle, accessibility) and **`docs/design/DESIGN.md`** (visual: OKLCH tokens incl. Signal Indigo as the single action accent and a lighter shade of it as the quiet secondary control, Manrope UI typography + scoped JetBrains Mono, status-badge pattern, hybrid elevation, mosaic dashboard composition, signature components — Topology Map / Circular Signal Meter / Live Data Tile, Apple-class motion contracts, full Do's and Don'ts).

Quick reminders the visual spec enforces:
- **Status badges**: always `variant="outline"` + `bg-{role}/15 text-{role} border-{role}/30` + `size-3` lucide icon. Solid variants are forbidden in feature surfaces. Reusable wrapper: `ServiceStatusBadge` at `components/local-network/service-status-badge.tsx`.
- **CardHeader**: plain `CardTitle` + `CardDescription`. No icons in headers; they go in badges or `CardAction`.
- **Save actions**: always use `SaveButton`.
- **Single typeface**: Manrope is the only UI font. The one sanctioned exception is **JetBrains Mono**, scoped strictly to the AT terminal and raw AT output (The Machine-Voice Rule); no other second font. Live numeric readouts use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`.
- **Brand colors**: Signal Indigo (`--primary`) is the single action accent — the only brand color. The `--secondary` token is a quiet functional control surface — a lighter, desaturated shade of the primary (`oklch(0.91 0.05 264)` light / `oklch(0.40 0.08 264)` dark), not an identity or brand color. There is no `--brand-teal`, no gradient, no duotone. Governing rule: *Indigo acts · Mono speaks for the machine.*
- **Page layout**: feature pages are a page header (`h1` + muted description) followed by a uniform grid of self-contained cards (the established shape, see `ttl-settings`). Apple-class professional UI/UX (macOS System Settings) is the north star, not UniFi's hero-mosaic. A hero/mosaic is a rare, deliberate exception for a genuine glance surface, never the default. UniFi is kept only for data density (dense outline pills / tables).
- **Card-Wrapped Surface Rule**: a feature's settings live **inside one self-contained `Card`** (the card is the unit the page grid arranges), never spread across a full-bleed page with cards as loose parts. Traffic Engine + the `Add Profile` card are the reference; the earlier full-page Custom Profiles versions are the anti-pattern. See `DESIGN.md` ("The Card-Wrapped Surface Rule") + `PRODUCT.md` (Principle 4).
- **Components**: use shadcn/ui primitives (tabs, accordion, dialog, popover, select, etc.) before hand-rolling; build custom only when shadcn does not provide one.

## Probing the Live Modem (Development)

A live test modem is reachable on the LAN; **SSH credentials live in `.env`** (`SSH_HOST`, `SSH_USERNAME`, `SSH_PASSWORD`). When debugging backend behavior, reproducing CGI output, verifying a shell-script change actually runs under the device's BusyBox `/bin/sh`, or sanity-checking that a fix landed on disk, probe the device via PowerShell's **Posh-SSH** module rather than guessing from code alone.

One-time install (per dev machine):

```powershell
Install-Module Posh-SSH -Scope CurrentUser
```

Quick pattern (read variables from `.env`, do NOT hardcode or echo secrets in transcripts):

```powershell
$cred = [pscredential]::new($env:SSH_USERNAME, (ConvertTo-SecureString $env:SSH_PASSWORD -AsPlainText -Force))
$sess = New-SSHSession -ComputerName $env:SSH_HOST -Credential $cred -AcceptKey -Force
(Invoke-SSHCommand -SessionId $sess.SessionId -Command 'uci show qmanager').Output
Remove-SSHSession -SessionId $sess.SessionId | Out-Null
```

Use it to: read live UCI config, inspect `/tmp/qmanager_*.json` runtime state, tail `/tmp/qmanager.log` and other logs, hit a CGI endpoint with `curl http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/quecmanager/...`, check lock files (`/var/run/qmanager_*.pid`, `/tmp/qmanager_*.lock`), exercise `qcmd` AT calls, confirm `nft list ruleset` after a DPI toggle, verify init.d state, and re-read written config after an apply.

**Safety:**
- Treat the modem as a live system. Avoid destructive commands (reboots, `AT+CFUN=1,1`, factory resets, package removals, `rm -rf`) without a stated reason.
- Never echo `.env` values back to the user or paste them into transcripts; reference the variable names instead.
- `.env` should remain gitignored. Verify with `git check-ignore .env` before committing anything in the repo root.

## Release Notes (`RELEASE_NOTE.md`)

Structure:
1. **One-paragraph summary** immediately after the version heading — 2–3 sentences max. State the release theme (e.g. "focused on X"), call out the headline feature(s), and note whether this is mainly new features, fixes, or polish. No bullet points here.
2. `## ✨ New Features` — headline additions only; short user-facing bullets, no internal function names.
3. `## ✅ Improvements` — fixes and polish; same bullet style. Headline fixes first.
4. `## 📥 Installation` — one-line fresh install command + Software Update upgrade path.
5. `## 💙 Thank You`

## Shared Constants
- **`ANTENNA_PORTS`** (`types/modem-status.ts`): canonical metadata for 4 ports (Main/PRX, Diversity/DRX, MIMO 3/RX2, MIMO 4/RX3). Used by `antenna-statistics` + `antenna-alignment`. Do not duplicate.
